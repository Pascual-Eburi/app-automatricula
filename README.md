# Backend Setup Guide

This guide outlines the setup process for the backend of your application, developed using Python, Django, Django Rest Framework, and PostgreSQL.

## Prerequisites

1. **Install Python and Pip**
   - Ensure Python (version 3.x) and pip are installed on your system.

2. **Install Virtualenv**
   - Use pip to install Virtualenv, which helps create isolated Python environments.
     ```sh
     pip install virtualenv
     ```

## Setup Instructions

3. **Create a Virtual Environment**
   - Navigate to your project directory and create a virtual environment.
     ```sh
     python -m venv your_virtual_env_name
     ```

4. **Activate the Virtual Environment**
   - Depending on your operating system:
     - On Windows:
       ```sh
       your_virtual_env_name\Scripts\activate
       ```
     - On macOS/Linux:
       ```sh
       source your_virtual_env_name/bin/activate
       ```

5. **Install Dependencies**
   - Install the required Python packages listed in `requirements.txt`.
     ```sh
     pip install -r requirements.txt
     ```

6. **Database Setup (PostgreSQL)**
   - Ensure PostgreSQL is installed and running on your system.
   - Update your Django project settings (`settings.py`) with your database configurations.

7. **Run Migrations**
   - Apply initial database migrations to set up your database schema.
     ```sh
     python manage.py migrate
     ```

8. **Start the Development Server**
   - Finally, start the Django development server to run your application locally.
     ```sh
     python manage.py runserver
     ```

9. **Access the Admin Panel (Optional)**
   - If you have set up the Django admin interface, you can access it at:
     ```
     http://localhost:8000/admin/
     ```

## Additional Notes

- Make sure to replace `your_virtual_env_name` with a suitable name for your virtual environment.
- Modify `requirements.txt` to include any additional dependencies your project requires.
- Always activate your virtual environment before working on or running your Django project.

This setup assumes familiarity with basic command-line usage and Python development. Adjust paths and commands as per your specific development environment and project structure.
